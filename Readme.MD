Welcome to the Bank OCR Challenge.

The link to the challenge details is here http://codingdojo.org/kata/BankOCR/

I provided an Input file and a Results file. Feel free to add your file to the 
directory and change FILENAME at the top of Challenge.js OR simply edit the one
I provided. 

This program relies on node and npm.

To run the app, navigate to the directory and run:
npm start

After execution, you'll see the results of the program in Results.txt.

Enjoy!
